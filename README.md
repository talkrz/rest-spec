# rest-spec

A simple library for documenting REST APIs, end to end testing written in PHP.

I do not recommend to use in on production yet, however will be happy if you will.

# Installation

You can install rest-spec by Composer.

Add package to your project's composer.json file:  

```bash
{
    "require-dev": {
        "talkrz/rest-spec": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

Install it with Composer:
```bash
composer install
```
